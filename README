1. Placeholders
SmartFactory allows for using placeholders in the histogram names:

 - @@@d -- this one will be used for directory name
 - @@@a -- this one will be used for factory name

By default, @@@d = @@@a and will be equal to factory name given
in the constructor. Both can be changes using rename(std::string)
and chdir(std::string) functions respectively. Placeholders are
placed with real values at the wiritng to file time.
